Iso Dark Theme for Godot
==============

Iso Dark is a clean, modern dark theme for the  [Godot Engine](http://www.godotengine.org), designed to make games early in development look good, and to be easily modified as a game matures.

#### To support these design goals, Iso Dark is build around the following concepts:
* **Ultra-minimalism:** Results a clean look, and more importantly is easily modified. Details can be more easily changed without breaking the overall feel. While elements like gradients and shadows can help with the overall presentation of a theme they would be difficult to match as it changes.
* **Light weight:** Iso Dark focuses on only a few core form so that they can be easily modified and replaced.
* **Two-tone:** The background is a warm black, and all other elements (with a few unavoidable exceptions) are either white or black, with varying transparency. This way, it should be easy to change a single element without clashing with the rest of the theme, and a simple background change can change the feel entire theme.
* **Non-distinctive elements:** Nothing in the theme should stand out to much from other themes players commonly see, and should blend into the game itself. Droid Sans was chosen as the default font for this reason, since in addition to being an attractive font with robust Unicode support, it is about as indistinct a font as can be found.
* **All assets are availible in their original format:** Iso Dark was designed in [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org), an open-source vector graphics progam, and files are availible in both svg and png. This should help with theme modification, so developers don't have to worry about recreating elements to match the theme, but can instead modify the originals.
* **CC0: For easier use in game jams.** While I would appreciate attribution for the theme, I know how difficult it is to keep track of everything that I do during a jam, and I know how much it helps to not have to worry about proper attribution.
